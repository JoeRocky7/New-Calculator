## Summary

This was by far the most difficult Javascript project i have completed so far, but I am glad I pushed through it because I learned a lot from it like the parseFloat method and a better understanding of how to logically come up with solutions to problems.

This project helped me improve my DRY code (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself), something I was struggling on my coding journey and now have a better grasp on.
